## Wireframing & Planning

## Technologies Used 

The frontend was built with React, CSS, Material UI and context API to manage state throught the app. The backend was built with firebase firestore utilizing BaaS and providing serverless development architecture. Due to the size of the application, I chose Firebase to implement autentication and data storage. I chose React, a javascript framework, for the frontend because it breaks down complex UI/UX developement into simple components while enhancing the user experience.
