# Empire Homes

# Description

My app is called Empire Estate. It is a Real Estate Listing website for people looking to purchase a new home. Users can make filtered searches in any city they are looking to relocate and save property listings that are actively for sale on the market. In the future, I would like to add a messaging platform so users will be able to send messages and request appointments in the app.
